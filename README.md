# Description
This repository will consist of image classifcation algorithm work using a neural network and is aimed at accurately distinguishing between five different yoga poses from a Kaggle Image Dataset.

# Dataset
Using Kaggle's Computer Image Datasets under Yoga Poses.

# Data Analysis
Uploaded the images that are found in this repository, but uploaded through google drive in the ipynb file. Additionally, I normalized, split, and flattened the data into a 1D array  for the dataset. Then I created a neural network to identify the speed and accuracy of the model. After, I evaluated the model and finished off with a conclusion of my findings.
